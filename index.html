    <p class="ramble">Homelessness is a difficult topic to discuss. A large portion of our population is deeply uncomfortable with the concept, and often has only experienced or thought of the stereotypical depiction of the homeless. The &quot;hobos,&quot; the &quot;crackheads,&quot; the &quot;dangerous insane man on the corner.&quot; These boil down very real homeless experiences into flanderized caricatures. There are several very real social issues baked into homelessness buried under these discomforts. Many homeless people ARE minorities, ARE mentally ill, and ARE suffering from substance abuse. Reframing these ideas and recontextualizing how homelessness occurs is the first major step towards advocating for these people and making their lives better.</p>

    <h2>What is homelessness?</h2>
    <p class="rambler">Homelessness is the lack of a consistent, stable, permanent shelter. It's one of the most dangerous aspects of living to lose, as it comes with so much external damage. No housing makes it extremely difficult to have access to work, which will impact any finances you may still have. No shelter also limits your access to water. You don't have clean accessible water to drink or clean yourself with. Money is tight, which also limits your access to food. Pretty much every core need necessary to living is threatened when you lose housing.</p>
  
    <h2>What does homelessness look like in America?</h2>
    <p class="rambler">Here's some quick facts from the <a href="https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/" class="link">Security.org Team</a>. in 2022, about 580,000 people were reported as homeless. It's important to note that the homeless are often called the &quot;Invisible Population,&quot; and that number can be far higher. We can see however that, compared to 2012, the number is decreasing! 2012 was reported to have about 620,000 homeless people in America. However, our homeless population IS growing. 2016-2017 was around when that decrease had stopped. Those years were in the 550,000 range. We have been steadily increasing ever since. The pandemic has certainly expanded the growth of these numbers, but we were on rising trend even 4 years prior.
      <br>In 2022 it was also found that majority of people experiencing homelessness is within cities &#40;LA and NYC having the largest of these numbers&#41;. These are likely people who don't have a support system and are opperating in cities with heavy work competition with few places to truly seek shelter.
      <br>There's also a huge difference in how homeless impacts different races. Black and Hispanic people both have a larger percentage of their population in America as homeless! Black people in particular have the post notable gap. They make up 14% of the national population but 37% of the homeless population.</p>

    <h2>How does this effect me?</h2>
    <p class="rambler">The fact of the matter is that society functions best when we are kind and empathetic to our fellow humans. Beyond the obviousness of &quot;It's The Right Thing To Do,&quot; questioning society and how it impacts our most vulnerable populations in the lens of humanity and kindness is the best way to forge a society built upon unity.
      <br>I'm not joking. It sounds corny, but it is the best remedy to properly addressing societal issues. Society is supposed to be good for us, to help us function. It is a failure if it is punishing people in need of help, and when we reframe our mindset that homeless people are people JUST LIKE US who need help? The way we usually speak about them starts to feel cruel. 
      <br>We so frequently punish them for taking up space, for &quot;pan-handling&quot; money they need to make it to the next day, for having the audacity to be mentally ill in PUBLIC even though they have no where else to go. Homeless is the culimnation of SO MANY ISSUES within our society, and yet it is so often presented to us as a black and white issue: that these people did something wrong and they are inconveincing you. Changing that rhetoric is the stepping stone to a kinder, more empathetic society.</p>

        <h2>Homelessness is not the result of laziness</h2>
        <p>
          Homelessness is most often the sudden and unfortunate result of many factors out of a person's control. Job layoffs, a loss of a roommate and no longer able to afford rent, rejected by family for your identity, or a mental health crisis with no support network to keep you safe.
          <br>Our society dictates that we must earn the right to survive. Necessities to live like food, water, and shelter are not garunteed when tragedy strikes. Our most vulnerable populations are getting called <span class="ytext">lazy</span> when they have to fight to survive every day.

        <h2>Homelessness doesn't discriminate</h2>
        <p>
          There's two major stereotypes for homeless people in America: the mentally ill dangerous &quot;crackhead,&quot; or the abandoned veteran. Even the most sympathetic version of this stereotype is extremely harmful and talks over the disproportionate number of homeless minorities.
          <br><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/gay-and-transgender-youth-homelessness-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank" class="link">A 2021 national survey</a> by the Trevor project found that nearly half of all the indigenous LGBT youth had experienced homelessness at one point in their life, and this was vastly disproportionate compared to white queer youths. <a href="https://www.projecthome.org/homelessness-facts" class="link">Project HOME</a> has always been outspoken about how white supremacy and the number of people of color left on the streets are not a coincidence. Addressing homelessness also means addressing the groups within it properly, NOT falling back on stereotypes.

        <h2>Criminalizing homelessness doesn't stop homelessness</h2>
        <p>
          The fact that homelessness is criminalized to begin with is a deeply unempathetic failing of our society, an attack on one of our most vulnerable populations. <a href="nchv.org/policing-and-punishment-based-approaches-a-really-expensive-way-to-make-homelessness-worse/" target="_blank" class="link">As noted by the NCHV</a>, criminalizing homelessness is only going to lead to chronic homelessness and put struggling people in more danger. Having a charge against you makes it much harder to get back on your feet, and will affect your ability to seek out work and obtain permanent housing.
          <br>Punishing the homeless will only push them deeper into their troubles. It is not a solution to homelessness. It perpetuates it. It's also worth noting that it is very dangerous to have such overpolicing of the homeless when so much of their population is made up of minorities. This puts them at an even greater risk of police brutality.

        <h2>Homelessness is not a moral failing</h2>
        <p>
          Connecting morality with work ethics and external factors is extremely dangerous. We are placing the blame of a society that is pay-to-survive on individuals. Implying homelessness is, inherently, a personal responsibility ignores the big picture. Considering the scale of our homeless population &#40;consistently in the <a href="https://www.projecthome.org/homelessness-facts" class="link">500,000</a> ballpark for several years now&#41; and the way it disproportionately impacts minorities, there is a clear system issue that is perpetuating this horrible situation.
          <br>Treating homelessness as a personal failure and the representation of their worth is not only a cruel thing to do: it prevents a nuanced conversation about how to END homelessness and prevent chronic homelessness.
